PWA app to track the things I want to buy

## prerequisites

You should have a <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">firebase</a> project dedicated to this app with a firestore database set up.
<br/>
Then you have to include your own firebase app config object in order to use the application. I have approached this via firebase.config.js file (which is ignored by the way) and exporting the object. But you can do it your way. 

## setup

I'm using <a href="https://vitejs.dev/" target="_blank">vite</a> for this project, the main scripts are included in package.json.
